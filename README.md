If you want you can go directly to the fansub view by pressing `cmd`.

## Set it up before researching

Search on Alfred2 `anidb` and select `AniDB Update Database`. This will dowload a AniDB database dump and create a new file that the workflow use to search. You can use this command only once per day.

From now on you're ready to use the workflow ;)
